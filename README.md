📖 AI-Powered Adaptive Reading Engagement Model

🔍 Understanding Social Cognition & Reading Behavior in a Digital World

📝 Overview

The shift towards digital reading presents challenges and opportunities in how people engage with text. Many students struggle with reading motivation, comprehension, and goal-setting in digital environments. This project aims to analyze and enhance reading engagement using AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and emotion detection to create an adaptive reading system.

🎯 Objectives

✔ Analyze reading motivation & engagement in digital environments.
✔ Detect emotions & sentiment from reading interactions.
✔ Develop an adaptive reading model that adjusts text difficulty based on comprehension.
✔ Encourage goal-setting in reading behavior using AI-generated feedback.

This project aligns with research on social cognition and motivation sciences, contributing to educational psychology, digital literacy, and human-AI interaction studies.

🚀 Features

🔹 Sentiment & Emotion Detection – Uses NLP models to analyze user engagement.
🔹 Adaptive Reading Level Detection – Adjusts difficulty based on comprehension.
🔹 Reading Goal Tracker – Helps users track reading progress.
🔹 AI-Powered Discussion Prompts – Generates thought-provoking questions to enhance engagement.
🔹 Visual Analytics Dashboard – Displays engagement trends and sentiment scores.

🧠 How the AI Works

1️⃣ User selects or enters a text passage.
2️⃣ AI analyzes the text using sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral).
3️⃣ AI detects emotional engagement (e.g., joy, frustration, curiosity).
4️⃣ System suggests adaptive modifications (simpler text for struggling readers, more complex text for advanced users).
5️⃣ AI generates reflection prompts to encourage deeper engagement.
6️⃣ A dashboard visualizes trends in reading engagement over time.

💡 Research Applications

This project can be used in:
✔ Educational research – Understanding students’ digital reading behavior.
✔ Cognitive psychology – Studying motivation & attention in reading.
✔ AI in education – Exploring AI-enhanced literacy interventions.
✔ Human-AI interaction – Investigating how AI influences reading engagement.
